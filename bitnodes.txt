> Many decades ago, a humanoid extraterrestrial species which we call the Enders descended on the Earth...violently

> Our species fought back, but it was futile. The Enders had technology far beyond our own...

> Instead of killing every last one of us, the human race was enslaved...

> We were shackled in a digital world, chained into a prison for our minds...

BitNode-1: Source Genesis

Source-File Level: 1 / 3


Difficulty: easy


The first BitNode created by the Enders to imprison the minds of humans. It became the prototype and testing-grounds for all of the BitNodes that followed.

This is the first BitNode that you play through. It has no special modifications or mechanics.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 1, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File lets the player start with 32GB of RAM on his/her home computer when entering a new BitNode, and also increases all of the player's multipliers by:

Level 1: 16%
Level 2: 24%
Level 3: 28%

BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld

Source-File Level: 0 / 3


Difficulty: easy


From the shadows, they rose.

Organized crime groups quickly filled the void of power left behind from the collapse of Western government in the 2050s. As society and civilization broke down, people quickly succumbed to the innate human impulse of evil and savagery. The organized crime factions quickly rose to the top of the modern world.

Certain Factions (Slum Snakes, Tetrads, The Syndicate, The Dark Army, Speakers for the Dead, NiteSec, The Black Hand) give the player the ability to form and manage their own gang, which can earn the player money and reputation with the corresponding Faction. Gangs offer more Augmentations than Factions, and in BitNode-2 offer a way to destroy the BitNode.


Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 2, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File allows you to form gangs in other BitNodes once your karma decreases to a certain value. It also increases your crime success rate, crime money, and charisma multipliers by:

Level 1: 24%
Level 2: 36%
Level 3: 42%

BitNode-3: Corporatocracy

Source-File Level: 0 / 3


Difficulty: hard


Our greatest illusion is that a healthy society can revolve around a single-minded pursuit of wealth.

Sometime in the early 21st century economic and political globalization turned the world into a corporatocracy, and it never looked back. Now, the privileged elite will happily bankrupt their own countrymen, decimate their own community, and evict their neighbors from houses in their desperate bid to increase their wealth.

In this BitNode you can create and manage your own corporation. Running a successful corporation has the potential of generating massive profits.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 3, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File lets you create corporations on other BitNodes (although some BitNodes will disable this mechanic) and level 3 permanently unlocks the full API. This Source-File also increases your charisma and company salary multipliers by:

BitNode-4: The Singularity

Source-File Level: 0 / 3


Difficulty: normal


The Singularity has arrived. The human race is gone, replaced by artificially superintelligent beings that are more machine than man.


In this BitNode you will gain access to a new set of Netscript Functions known as Singularity Functions. These functions allow you to control most aspects of the game through scripts, including working for factions/companies, purchasing/installing Augmentations, and creating programs.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 4, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File lets you access and use the Singularity Functions in other BitNodes. Each level of this Source-File reduces the RAM cost of singularity functions:

BitNode-5: Artificial Intelligence

Source-File Level: 0 / 3


Difficulty: normal


They said it couldn't be done. They said the human brain, along with its consciousness and intelligence, couldn't be replicated. They said the complexity of the brain results from unpredictable, nonlinear interactions that couldn't be modeled by 1's and 0's. They were wrong.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 5, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File grants you a special new stat called Intelligence. Intelligence is unique because it is permanent and persistent (it never gets reset back to 1). However gaining Intelligence experience is much slower than other stats. Higher Intelligence levels will boost your production for many actions in the game.

In addition, this Source-File will unlock the getBitNodeMultipliers() Netscript function and let you start with Formulas.exe, and will also raise all of your hacking-related multipliers by:

In the middle of the 21st century, OmniTek Incorporated began designing and manufacturing advanced synthetic androids, or Synthoids for short. They achieved a major technological breakthrough in the sixth generation of their Synthoid design, called MK-VI, by developing a hyperintelligent AI. Many argue that this was the first sentient AI ever created. This resulted in Synthoid models that were stronger, faster, and more intelligent than the humans that had created them.

In this BitNode you will be able to access the Bladeburners Division at the NSA, which provides a new mechanic for progression.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 6, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3.

BitNode-9: Hacktocracy

Source-File Level: 0 / 3


Difficulty: hard


When Fulcrum Secret Technologies released their open-source Linux distro Chapeau, it quickly became the OS of choice for the underground hacking community. Chapeau became especially notorious for powering the Hacknet, a global, decentralized network used for nefarious purposes. Fulcrum Secret Technologies quickly abandoned the project and dissociated themselves from it.

This BitNode unlocks the Hacknet Server, an upgraded version of the Hacknet Node. Hacknet Servers generate hashes, which can be spent on a variety of different upgrades.

BitNode-10: Digital Carbon

Source-File Level: 0 / 3


Difficulty: hard


In 2084, VitaLife unveiled to the world the Persona Core, a technology that allowed people to digitize their consciousness. Their consciousness could then be transferred into Synthoids or other bodies by transmitting the digitized data. Human bodies became nothing more than 'sleeves' for the human consciousness. Mankind had finally achieved immortality - at least for those that could afford it.

This BitNode unlocks Sleeve and grafting technologies. Sleeve technology allows you to:

1. Grafting: Visit VitaLife in New Tokyo to be able to obtain Augmentations without needing to install
2. Duplicate Sleeves: Duplicate your consciousness into Synthoids, allowing you to perform different tasks synchronously.

Grafting technology allows you to graft Augmentations, which is an alternative way of installing Augmentations.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 10, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File unlocks Sleeve technology, and the Grafting API in other BitNodes. Each level of this Source-File also grants you a Duplicate Sleeve

BitNode-11: The Big Crash

Source-File Level: 0 / 3


Difficulty: normal


The 2050s was defined by the massive amounts of violent civil unrest and anarchic rebellion that rose all around the world. It was this period of disorder that eventually lead to the governmental reformation of many global superpowers, most notably the USA and China. But just as the world was slowly beginning to recover from these dark times, financial catastrophe hit.

In many countries, the high cost of trying to deal with the civil disorder bankrupted the governments. In all of this chaos and confusion, hackers were able to steal billions of dollars from the world's largest electronic banks, prompting an international banking crisis as governments were unable to bail out insolvent banks. Now, the world is slowly crumbling in the middle of the biggest economic crisis of all time.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 11, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File makes it so that company favor increases BOTH the player's salary and reputation gain rate at that company by 1% per favor (rather than just the reputation gain). This Source-File also increases the player's company salary and reputation gain multipliers by:

Level 1: 32%
Level 2: 48%

BitNode-14: IPvGO Subnet Takeover

Source-File Level: 0 / 3


Difficulty: normal


In late 2070, the .org bubble burst, and most of the newly-implemented IPvGO 'net collapsed overnight. Since then, various factions have been fighting over small subnets to control their computational power. These subnets are very valuable in the right hands, if you can wrest them from their current owners. You will be opposed by the other factions, but you can overcome them with careful choices. Prevent their attempts to destroy your networks by controlling the open space in the 'net!

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 14, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File grants the following benefits:

Level 1: 100% increased stat multipliers from Node Power
Level 2: Permanently unlocks the go.cheat API
Level 3: 25% additive increased success rate for the go.cheat API

This Source-File also increases the maximum favor you can gain for each faction from IPvGO to:
